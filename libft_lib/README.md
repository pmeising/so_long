Core Curriculum of 42 School

### Goal: Write our own library for string and memory handling. Functions can be used in future projects.

### Content: Contains 43 functions which are useful for working with strings and values in C.


This project is intended to introduce us learners to the world of C programming. We handle strings and modify them. Memory handling is learned in several ways such as contiguous memory allocation as well as dynamic memory allocation. We got a look at the data structure Linked Lists. This project constitues a great starting point and base for future projects.
